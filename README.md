# Confidential Transactions

Confidential Transactions is a repository designed to work with and create an ERC-20 token that supports "CONFIDENTIAL TRANSACTIONS" using zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge). zk-SNARKs is a highly secure cryptographic technique that leverages Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to create encrypted data that can be efficiently verified without revealing sensitive information.

## Introduction

Confidential Transactions leverages zk-SNARKs to enhance the privacy and security of ERC-20 token transactions. In traditional ERC-20 tokens, transaction details such as sender, receiver, and amounts are publicly visible on the blockchain. However, with Confidential Transactions, the sender's and receiver's addresses are not hidden, but the balances and transaction amounts remain confidential.

The core idea behind Confidential Transactions is that the sender and receiver utilize their starting balances and transaction values as private inputs while revealing only hashes of the starting balance, ending balance, and value as public inputs. This approach provides a layer of privacy to token transactions without revealing sensitive information to the public.

## How It Works

Confidential Transactions achieves privacy and confidentiality through the following key steps:

1. **Private Inputs**: Sender and receiver use their starting balances and transaction values as private inputs.

2. **Public Inputs**: Hashes of starting balance, ending balance, and value are used as public inputs.

3. **zk-SNARKs**: Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs) is employed to create cryptographic proofs that validate the transaction without revealing the confidential data.

4. **Verification**: Anyone can verify the transaction's validity by checking the zk-SNARK proof without gaining access to sensitive information.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start working with Confidential Transactions, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- Ethereum development environment (e.g., [Brownie](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache))

## Usage

To use Confidential Transactions, follow these general steps:

1. Deploy the Confidential Transactions smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
2. Create confidential ERC-20 token transactions using zk-SNARKs proofs.
3. Verify the transactions on-chain without revealing confidential data.
