# Confidential-Transactions
### This is a repo to work with and create a ERC-20 token that supports "CONFIDENTIAL TRANSACTIONS" by using "zk-SNARKs". 
### The zk-SNARKs is a type of highly secure cryptographic testing that uses Zero Knowledge Testing (ZKP) principles to create encrypted data that can be easily verified without revealing sensitive information about such data.
